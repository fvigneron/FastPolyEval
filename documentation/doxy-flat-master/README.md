# What?
A set of resources to use with the excellent **[Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/index.html)** to achieve a "flatter" look out of the box.

## Why?
I wanted to have a tighter view of the generated docs. Personally I like plainer docs where the relevant information is not obscured by 'fanciness' or 'shenanigans'. Fanciness includes:

  - The "shine" on the tabs/bars 
  - The most of the rounded corners
  - The shadows on the text and divs

## How?
It's fairly simple for the most part. Doxygen allows users to include extra CSS files, which override the provided style sheets. This project is just some CSS you can include to get a start on your own version of documentation Nirvana.
