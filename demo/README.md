# Demonstrations & benchmarks

This repository illustrates the installation process and how to use the main features of `FastPolyEval`.

  - `live_demo.sh`         : Interactive demo (for Linux/MacOS) that performs a fresh install in `$HOME/FPE_Demo` then runs some example commands.
  - `pts_sphere.sh`        : Bash script to generate uniformly distributed points on the sphere.
  - `pts_disk.sh`          : Bash script to generate uniformly distributed points on a disk.
  - `bmk_hyp.sh`           : Bash script to benchmark interactively the family of hyperbolic polynomials.
  - `bmk_normal.sh`        : Bash script to benchmark interactively the family of polynomials with random gaussian coefficients.

Please update the path to the `FastPolyEval` binary before using the scripts.
